## HTML Ruls
* No space is allowed to exist between the opening bracket and the tag name. And likewise, space is not allowed between the opening bracket and the foreword slash of the closing tag. 
* However, you must have at least one space between the tag itself and any of its attributes, and space is allowed everywhere else and is simply ignored. 
* attributes can only be specified on the opening tag, so you can't specify an attribute on the closing tag
* Self-closing tag: `<p/>` <=> `<p></p>` in XML, but only use the latter in HTML5.
